# Top-View-Vehicle-Detection
Top-View Vehicle Detection enhances traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and smart city applications using image processing and segmentation. It applies noise reduction (Gaussian, Median, Wiener, Bilateral Filters), segmentation (K-Means, Mean Shift, Graph-Based), and region-based processing (CCA, Region-Growing) for accurate detection
